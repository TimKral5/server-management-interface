1. Setup

   First clone the repository. Then, run "npm install" to setup the
   dependencies.

2. The Backend

   The backend doesn't need any building and is simply runnable over
   "npm run backend".

   It does, however, have a client module that can be built using
   "npm run backend-lib".

   To test the functionality of the API, run "npm test".

3. The Frontend Styles

   This project does not yet provide a frontend. But it has a
   component library that will be used. It can be built using
   "npm run build-styles".

   There is a way to test the styles. This works using
   "npm run styles", which builds the testing data and then the
   styles.

4. Development Server

   The files in the "out/" directory can be served via
   "npm run dev", which simply launches a static webserver.
